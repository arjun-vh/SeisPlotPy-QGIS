# SeisPlotPy (QGIS Plugin)

**SeisPlotPy** is a acoustic subsurface data visualization and interpretation plugin for **QGIS**.  
It allows users to load, view, navigate, and interpret **SEG-Y (post-stack) seismic data** directly inside QGIS.

SeisPlotPy is designed for earth scientists, researchers, students, and geophysics workflows involving seismic reflection or sub-bottom profiler data.

---

## Features

- Load and visualize **SEG-Y** files (via `segyio`)
- Interactive controls for:
- Various Colormaps (e.g., seismic, grayscale, etc.)
- Linked **navigation with QGIS map canvas**
- Horizon picking and editing
- Export figures for publications and reports
- Supports **pyqtgraph** for fast seismic rendering
- Built with PyQt and integrates naturally with QGIS UI
